Privacy Policy for Intelli-Notes App

## Intelli-Notes: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Intelli-Notes app for Android!

This app is available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. App does not collect any data, all data like images, text are stored on Backend and texts are encrypted and only you(user) can only read it. App requires permission to access to Camera, Internet, Write and Read to External Storage.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,  
Nikhil Singla.
